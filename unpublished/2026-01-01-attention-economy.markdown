# Thoughts on Living in the Attention Economy

We used to say that time is money. Now we know that attention is power.

The phrase “attention economy” was popularized by [Herbert A. Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon), who observed that “a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.” His insight feels prophetic. We live in a world where information is infinite, but our focus is painfully finite. Every notification, headline, vibration, autoplay video, and algorithmic suggestion competes for the same scarce resource: our awareness.

To live in the attention economy is to live inside a marketplace where you are both the customer and the product.

## The Commodification of Focus

Platforms like [Meta](https://about.meta.com/), [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) are not primarily in the business of connection or creativity. They are in the business of engagement. Their success depends on capturing—and holding—your attention.

## Tools and Strategies to Opt Out of the Attention Economy

Living in the attention economy doesn’t mean surrendering your focus—it means creating barriers between your mind and the algorithms designed to hijack it. Here’s a practical guide to reducing your exposure, increasing friction, and reclaiming your attention on social media, professional networks, and other high-stimulation platforms.  

### 1. Browser Extensions and App Blockers

Adding tools that restrict or shape your usage is one of the simplest ways to fight the attention economy:

- **Content Blockers & Distraction-Free Extensions:**  
  - **Freedom** – Blocks websites and apps across devices.  
  - **LeechBlock NG** – Customize which sites are blocked and when.  
  - **StayFocusd** – Limit time spent on selected websites.  

- **Social Media Specific Tools:**  
  - **Unhook for Facebook** – Hides the news feed while keeping Messenger functional.  
  - **News Feed Eradicator (Facebook & LinkedIn)** – Replaces endless feeds with quotes or reminders.  
  - **Minimalist for Instagram** – Removes distracting sections like suggested posts or reels.  

- **Mobile App Solutions:**  
  - **Forest** – Gamifies focus and discourages phone browsing.  
  - **Focus@Will** – Encourages productivity with curated music and focus timers.  
  - **iOS Screen Time / Android Digital Wellbeing** – Built-in trackers to limit app use.

### 2. Increasing Friction

One of the most effective ways to reduce mindless scrolling is to make it harder to access attention-draining features:

- **Log Out After Each Session** – Typing your password every time creates a pause that encourages reflection.  
- **Remove Apps from Your Home Screen** – Keep them buried in folders or on a secondary screen.  
- **Use a Web Browser Instead of the App** – Many sites are slower or less seamless on desktop, which naturally reduces engagement.  
- **Turn Off Notifications** – Only allow critical alerts, like messages or calls; mute likes, comments, and updates.  
- **Batch Social Media Time** – Pick one or two short windows per day for checking feeds instead of constant access.

### 3. Mindful Design Tweaks

Small changes to your environment can subtly discourage mindless behavior:

- **Dark Mode or Reduced Colors** – Less visually stimulating, reducing impulsive clicks.  
- **Read-Only or Feed-Free Modes** – Some tools let you browse your networks without algorithmic suggestions.  
- **Auto-Play Off** – Videos and reels are designed to trap attention; disabling auto-play stops the cycle.  
- **Use Text-Based or RSS Versions** – Services like Feedly let you read updates without the endless scroll of images and ads.

### 4. Rethinking Social Media

- Ask yourself: *“Why am I here?”* Focus on intentional use rather than habit.  
- Curate your connections and subscriptions to include only what provides value.  
- Periodically audit your accounts, removing anything that doesn’t enrich your time or knowledge.

Living in the attention economy isn’t about escaping technology—it’s about reclaiming agency. By combining blockers, friction, and intentional design, you can start spending your attention consciously rather than having it stolen.
