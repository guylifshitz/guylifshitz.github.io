## Why Generative AI is forcing us to reconsider trust in images and their sources

We often think of photography as a turning point in human history—a moment when truth could be captured with a click of a shutter. For over a century, photographs gave us a sense of certainty: if it was in the image, it must have happened. We didn’t need to question the source; the picture itself was evidence.  

## Trust Without Question

Before photography, every account of an event, every visual representation, relied on the **trustworthiness of its creator**. A painting, a drawing, or even a written description could be interpreted, exaggerated, or biased. Consumers of information had to **judge the source**, considering the artist’s perspective, intentions, and credibility. Truth was mediated by human interpretation, not captured mechanically.  

Photography changed that. The camera acted as a neutral observer, and for generations, society assumed that **images were objective records**. A photograph of a city street, a political rally, or a natural disaster carried an inherent authority. People trusted what they saw without necessarily asking who made it.  

## The GenAI Challenge

Today, Generative AI is shifting us back to that pre-photography era—but with far greater complexity. AI can create images, videos, and even audio that **look and sound real**, yet are entirely fabricated. Unlike a traditional photograph, a GenAI creation **cannot be taken at face value**.  

We now face a paradox: the more realistic the content, the more we **must consider the source and context**. Every digital artifact demands scrutiny: Who generated it? For what purpose? What biases or intentions shaped it? In this sense, we are returning to a world where **trust in the creator**—rather than trust in the medium—is essential.  

## Learning to See Again

GenAI forces us to relearn skills we forgot in the photographic age: **critical thinking, source evaluation, and contextual awareness**. We must interrogate images as we once interrogated paintings. The shift is not merely technological; it’s philosophical. Reality, once assumed to be objectively captured, now requires active discernment.  

Photography gave us comfort in certainty. GenAI reminds us that **seeing is no longer believing**. We are navigating a return to the pre-photography challenge: understanding that truth depends as much on who is telling the story as on what the story appears to show.
