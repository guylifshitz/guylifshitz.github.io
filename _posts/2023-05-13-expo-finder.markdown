Paris has hundreds of exhibitons at a time. Finding the ones that interest you, and keeping track of which ones will end soon can be difficult. I created a tool to help me keep track of all these exhibitons. Currently the output is a CSV that has to be imported into Google Drive, but I am working on building a proper website for this. Some friends are using the tool but I hope to make this a proper product soon.
