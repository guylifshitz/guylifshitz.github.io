A quick and simple game I made to teach basic game coding at the “We Are Not the Number We Think We Are ” event held by Bétonsalon Centre for Contemporary Art and Research, hosted at la Cité International des Arts. Made with [Stencyl](https://www.stencyl.com/){:target="_blank"}, a no-code tool for making games.
