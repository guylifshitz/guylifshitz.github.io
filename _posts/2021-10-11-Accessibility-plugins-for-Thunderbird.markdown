Built in a team during a Hackathon in Paris (La Nuit du Code Citoyen, October 2021), working with the accessibility non-profit [A.C.I.A.H.](https://aciah.xyz/){:target="_blank"}. We created a new accessibility plugin for Thunderbird, and updated an existing plugin to work with the newest version of Thunderbird. Worked on this with Max. 





### TabControl:
This Thunderbird extension aims at reducing the number of coexisting tabs during a session.

We keep track of currently opened mail tabs, in order to keep their number below a set value, 3 by default. This value can be changed in the addon's settings. When opening new mail tabs, additional tabs are closed, starting with the oldest.

### DontRestoreTabsRevival:
This extension allows the user not to restore tabs at startup in Thundertbird.
