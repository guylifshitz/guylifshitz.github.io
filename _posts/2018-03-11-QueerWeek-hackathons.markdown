The Carrefour numérique²—part of the Cité des sciences in Paris hosted two queer hackathons as part of the Queer Week festival (2018 and 2019). Participants came together to explore a wide range of topics like discrimination, feminism, and LGBTQ+ rights, all while working in a collaborative, hands-on setting. The goal was to create meaningful prototypes that addressed issues important to the queer community and could be showcased during Queer Week, a broader festival focused on gender and sexuality.

The event drew around 60 people, mostly from LGBTQ+ backgrounds, many of whom were experiencing both a hackathon and a fablab for the first time. Projects ranged from creative reinterpretations of gendered household tools to practical resources for LGBTQ+ individuals facing discrimination. While some initiatives focused on legal aid and advocacy, others explored artistic expression—such as a virtual queer museum and a platform to highlight queer artists and their stories. The atmosphere was informal, with an emphasis on learning, experimenting, and community-building rather than competition. 

The second edition was organized by me and Jad.
