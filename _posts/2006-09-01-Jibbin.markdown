A 3D free-skiing game I wrote when I wasâ€¦ 16, no harsh judgements on the graphics and gameplay please :).

I am going to upload the game to this server as soon as I can get my hands on my old hard drive.

Conceived as open-source, allowing the community to customize their game by making new levels and characters.
