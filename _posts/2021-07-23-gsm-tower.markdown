Artist: Tal Engelstein

Date: 23.7.2021

Location: Levinsky Market Parking Lot

​Artist’s description of the work:

A stream of text messages is sent from a pirate cellular antenna – that is wired to a red parking car – to the cell phones of random passers-by in Levinsky Market.

The script rolls out a sequence of messages from a woman in distress who lives somewhere near the market. She is isolated, asking for groceries and emotional support – her life needs saving.
