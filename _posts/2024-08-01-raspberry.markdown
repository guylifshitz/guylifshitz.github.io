Consultant for Tal Engelstein’s project "Epsilon" at the CCA – Center for Contemporary Art.

Helped design the prototype for a Raspberry Pi device with mobile data connectivity and microphone, keeping within cost, functionality, and spatial constraints required for the work.

Consulted on audio AI considerations and ran early experiments to help the artist understand what was possible with current technology.
