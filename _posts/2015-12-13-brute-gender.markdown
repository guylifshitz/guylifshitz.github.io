An Android app I developped to help learn masculin and feminin words in French by brute force. I have recently worked on a web interface with more functionality (saving words to word lists, analysis of text to find rare words and create word lists based on rare words in domain-specific texts) but I didn’t have time to complete it. The project may re-emerge soon as I get a better knowledge of french linguistics resources.

Practice your french genders until you get them right!

In conversation you won’t have time to figure out what the ending of a word is to figure out its gender. So why would you learn gender associations that way? This app helps you practice all the french words until you know them by heart, while also providing you with a list of words you got wrong that you can practice on.

Features:

    Words are ordered into sets according to word frequency in the language. This way you can tailor the experience to your level.
    Words definitions are shown
    You can select words you want to add to the practice list, or have words you got wrong added automatically.
